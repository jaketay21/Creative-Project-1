        In Eukaryotic cells, nuclei contain most of the DNA of the cell,
        which is responsible for holding genetic information. DNA is bundled up
        by protein complexes to form chromosomes. Proteins in the nucleus control
        the expression (transcription) of various genes, and their transcribed
        product (mRNA) is processed and brought out of the nucleus to Ribosomes.
        Ribosomes are enzymes that translate the mRNA into the protein they code
        for, and they are found in the membrane of the nucleus and ER, as well
        as in the cytoplasm
