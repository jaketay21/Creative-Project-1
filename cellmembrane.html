            The cell membrane separates the inside of the cell from the
            extracellular space. It is composed of a lipid bilayer with membrane-bound
            proteins. The cell membrane has the primary roles of protecting the cell, as
            well as maintaining concentrations of certain chemicals that are important
            for a cell's homeostasis. Certain molecules can passively diffuse through
            the membrane, whereas others need the help of transport proteins to do so.
            Some molecules need energy activation to be able to pass in or out of 
            a cell.
