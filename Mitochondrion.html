            Mitochondria are responsible for many biochemical mechanisms that 
            are crucial for an organism's survival. The most notable is ATP synthesis.
            ATP is a nucleic acid that is used by many proteins as an activating agent,
            or in other words, an energy source. Besides ATP synthesis, mitochondria have
            important functions in other metabolic processes, such as fatty acid synthesis
            and amino acid catabolism. Mitochondria also has its own DNA and translates
            its own proteins, and is the only organelle besides the nucleus that does.
