            The membrane of the endoplasmic recticulum (ER) is connected
            with the outer nuclear membrane. There are two types of ER: rough (granular)
            and smooth (agranular). The rough ER is studded with ribosomes, which are responsible
            for the translation of mRNA that comes from the nucleus. The smooth ER has the main
            role of creating lipids, which are the core structure of membranes.
